### Chapter 1 Introduction and exploring raw data ###
# Here's what messy data looks like
# View the first 6 rows of data
head(weather)

# View the last 6 rows of data
tail(weather)

# View a condensed summary of the data
str(weather)

# Here's what clean data looks like
# View the first 6 rows of data
head(weather_clean)

# View the last 6 rows of data
tail(weather_clean)

# View a condensed summary of the data
str(weather_clean)

# Getting a feel for your data
# Check the class of bmi
class(bmi)

# Check the dimensions of bmi
dim(bmi)

# View the column names of bmi
colnames(bmi)

# Viewing the structure of your data
# Check the structure of bmi
str(bmi)

# Load dplyr
library(dplyr)

# Check the structure of bmi, the dplyr way
glimpse(bmi)

# View a summary of bmi
summary(bmi)

# Looking at your data
# Print bmi to the console
bmi

# View the first 6 rows
head(bmi)

# View the first 15 rows
head(bmi, n = 15)

# View the last 6 rows
tail(bmi)

# View the last 10 rows
tail(bmi, n = 10)

# Visualizing your data
# Histogram of BMIs from 2008
hist(bmi$Y2008)

# Scatter plot comparing BMIs from 1980 to those from 2008
plot(bmi$Y1980, bmi$Y2008)

### Chapter 2 Tidying Data ###
# Gathering columns into key-value pairs
# Apply gather() to bmi and save the result as bmi_long
bmi_long <- gather(bmi, year, bmi_val, -Country)

# View the first 20 rows of the result
head(bmi_long, n = 20)

# Spreading key-value pairs into columns
# Apply spread() to bmi_long
bmi_wide <- spread(bmi_long, year, bmi_val)

# View the head of bmi_wide
head(bmi_wide)

# Separating Columns
# Apply separate() to bmi_cc
bmi_cc_clean <- separate(bmi_cc, col = Country_ISO, into = c("Country", "ISO"), sep = "/")

# Print the head of the result
head(bmi_cc_clean)

# Uniting columns
# Apply unite() to bmi_cc_clean
bmi_cc <- unite(bmi_cc_clean, Country_ISO, Country, ISO, sep = "-")

# View the head of the result
head(bmi_cc)

# Column headers are values, not variable names
## tidyr and dplyr are already loaded for you

# View the head of census
head(census)

# Gather the month columns
census2 <- gather(census, month, amount, - YEAR)

# Arrange rows by YEAR using dplyr's arrange
census2 <- arrange(census2, YEAR)

# View first 20 rows of census2
head(census2, n = 20)

# Variables are stored in both rows and columns
## tidyr is already loaded for you

# View first 50 rows of census_long
head(census_long, n = 50)

# Spread the type column
census_long2 <- spread(census_long, type, amount)

# View first 20 rows of census_long2
head(census_long2, n = 20)

# Multiple values are stored in one column
## tidyr is already loaded for you

# View the head of census_long3
head(census_long3)

# Separate the yr_month column into two
census_long4 <- separate(census_long3, col = yr_month, into = c("year", "month"), sep = "_")

# View the first 6 rows of the result
head(census_long4)

### Chapter 3 Preparing data for analysis ###
# Types of variables in R
# Make this evaluate to character
class("true")

# Make this evaluate to numeric
class(8484.00)

# Make this evaluate to integer
class(99L)

# Make this evaluate to factor
class(factor("factor"))

# Make this evaluate to logical
class(FALSE)

# Common type conversions
# Preview students with str()
str(students)

# Coerce Grades to character
students$Grades <- as.character(students$Grades)

# Coerce Medu to factor
students$Medu <- as.factor(students$Medu)

# Coerce Fedu to factor
students$Fedu <- as.factor(students$Medu)
    
# Look at students once more with str()
str(students)

# Working with dates
# Preview students2 with str()
str(students2)

# Load the lubridate package
library(lubridate)

# Parse as date
as.Date("17 Sep 2015", format = '%d %b %Y')

# Parse as date and time (with no seconds!)
mdy_hm("July 15, 2012 12:56")

# Coerce dob to a date (with no time)
students2$dob <- dmy(students2$dob)

# Coerce nurse_visit to a date and time
students2$nurse_visit <- mdy_hm(students2$nurse_visit)
    
# Look at students2 once more with str()
str(students2)

# Trimming and padding strings
# Load the stringr package
library(stringr)

# Trim all leading and trailing whitespace
str_trim(c("   Filip ", "Nick  ", " Jonathan"))

# Pad these strings with leading zeros
str_pad(c("23485W", "8823453Q", "994Z"), width = 9, side = "left", pad = "0")

# Upper and lower case
# Print state abbreviations
states

# Make states all uppercase and save result to states_upper
states_upper <- toupper(states)

# Make states_upper all lowercase again
tolower(states_upper)

# Finding and replacing strings
## stringr has been loaded for you

# Look at the head of students2
head(students2)

# Detect all dates of birth (dob) in 1997
str_detect(students2$dob, "1997")

# In the sex column, replace "F" with "Female"...
students2$sex <- str_replace(students2$sex, "F", "Female")

# ...And "M" with "Male"
students2$sex <- str_replace(students2$sex, "M", "Male")

# View the head of students2
head(students2)

# Finding missing values
# Call is.na() on the full social_df to spot all NAs
is.na(social_df)

# Use the any() function to ask whether there are any NAs in the data
any(is.na(social_df))

# View a summary() of the dataset
summary(social_df)

# Call table() on the status column
table(social_df$status)

# Dealing with missing values
## The stringr package is preloaded

# Replace all empty strings in status with NA
social_df$status[social_df$status == ""] <- NA

# Print social_df to the console
social_df

# Use complete.cases() to see which rows have no missing values
complete.cases(social_df)

# Use na.omit() to remove all rows with any missing values
na.omit(social_df)

# Dealing with outliers and obvious errors
# Look at a summary() of students3
summary(students3)

# View a histogram of the age variable
hist(students3$age)

# View a histogram of the absences variable
hist(students3$absences)

# View a histogram of absences, but force zeros to be bucketed to the right of zero
hist(students3$absences, right = FALSE)

# Another look at strange values
# View a boxplot of age
boxplot(students3$age)

# View a boxplot of absences
boxplot(students3$absences)

# Another obvious error
# Look at summary of Mean.VisibilityMiles
