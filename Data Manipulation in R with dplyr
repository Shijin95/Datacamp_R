# Chapter 1 Introduction to dplyr and tbls ###
# Load the dplyr and hflights package
# Load the dplyr package
library(dplyr)

# Load the hflights package
library(hflights)

# Call both head() and summary() on hflights
head(hflights)
summary(hflights)

# Convert data.frame to tibble
# Both the dplyr and hflights packages are loaded

# Convert the hflights data.frame into a hflights tbl
hflights <- tbl_df(hflights)

# Display the hflights tbl
hflights

# Create the object carriers
carriers <- hflights$UniqueCarrier

# Changing labels of hflights, part 1 of 2
# Both the dplyr and hflights packages are loaded into workspace
lut <- c("AA" = "American", "AS" = "Alaska", "B6" = "JetBlue", "CO" = "Continental", 
         "DL" = "Delta", "OO" = "SkyWest", "UA" = "United", "US" = "US_Airways", 
         "WN" = "Southwest", "EV" = "Atlantic_Southeast", "F9" = "Frontier", 
         "FL" = "AirTran", "MQ" = "American_Eagle", "XE" = "ExpressJet", "YV" = "Mesa")

# Add the Carrier column to hflights
hflights$Carrier <- lut[hflights$UniqueCarrier]

# Glimpse at hflights
glimpse(hflights)

# Changing labels of hflights, part 2 of 2
# The hflights tbl you built in the previous exercise is available in the workspace.

# The lookup table
lut <- c("A" = "carrier", "B" = "weather", "C" = "FFA", "D" = "security", "E" = "not cancelled")

# Add the Code column
hflights$Code <- lut[hflights$CancellationCode]

# Glimpse at hflights
glimpse(hflights)

# Chapter 2 Select and mutate ###
# Choosing is not losing! The select verb
# hflights is pre-loaded as a tbl, together with the necessary libraries.

# Print out a tbl with the four columns of hflights related to delay
select(hflights, ActualElapsedTime, AirTime, ArrDelay, DepDelay)

# Print out the columns Origin up to Cancelled of hflights
select(hflights, Origin : Cancelled)

# Answer to last question: be concise!
select(hflights, Year : DayOfWeek, ArrDelay : Diverted)

# dplyr comes with a set of helper functions that can help you select groups of variables inside a select() call:
# starts_with("X"): every name that starts with "X",
# ends_with("X"): every name that ends with "X",
# contains("X"): every name that contains "X",
# matches("X"): every name that matches "X", where "X" can be a regular expression,
# num_range("x", 1:5): the variables named x01, x02, x03, x04 and x05,
# one_of(x): every name that appears in x, which should be a character vector.

# Helper functions for variable selection
# As usual, hflights is pre-loaded as a tbl, together with the necessary libraries.

# Print out a tbl containing just ArrDelay and DepDelay
select(hflights, ends_with("Delay"))

# Print out a tbl as described in the second instruction, using both helper functions and variable names
select(hflights, UniqueCarrier, FlightNum, TailNum, Cancelled, CancellationCode)

# Print out a tbl as described in the third instruction, using only helper functions.
select(hflights, ends_with("Time"), ends_with("Delay"))

# Comparison to base R
# both hflights and dplyr are available

# Finish select call so that ex1d matches ex1r
ex1r <- hflights[c("TaxiIn", "TaxiOut", "Distance")]
ex1d <- select(hflights, starts_with("Taxi"), Distance)

# Finish select call so that ex2d matches ex2r
ex2r <- hflights[c("Year", "Month", "DayOfWeek", "DepTime", "ArrTime")]
ex2d <- select(hflights, 1:6, -3)

# Finish select call so that ex3d matches ex3r
ex3r <- hflights[c("TailNum", "TaxiIn", "TaxiOut")]
ex3d <- select(hflights, starts_with("Taxi"), TailNum)

# Mutating is creating
# hflights and dplyr are loaded and ready to serve you.

# Add the new variable ActualGroundTime to a copy of hflights and save the result as g1.
g1 <- mutate(hflights, ActualGroundTime = ActualElapsedTime - AirTime)

# Add the new variable GroundTime to g1. Save the result as g2.
g2 <- mutate(g1, GroundTime = TaxiIn + TaxiOut)

# Add the new variable AverageSpeed to g2. Save the result as g3.
g3 <- mutate(g2, AverageSpeed = Distance / AirTime * 60)

# Print out g3
g3

# Add multiple variables using mutate
# hflights and dplyr are ready, are you?

# Add a second variable loss_ratio to the dataset: m1
m1 <- mutate(hflights, loss = ArrDelay - DepDelay, loss_ratio = loss / DepDelay)

# Add the three variables as described in the third instruction: m2
m2 <- mutate(hflights, TotalTaxi = TaxiIn + TaxiOut, ActualGroundTime = ActualElapsedTime - AirTime, Diff = TotalTaxi - ActualGroundTime)

# Chapter 3 Filter and arrange
# Logical operators
